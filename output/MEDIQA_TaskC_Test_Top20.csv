Follow-up of chronic problem.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Ms. Carolyn Garcia is a 49-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for follow-up of her chronic problem.

The patient reports her osteoarthritis has been flaring up a little lately, and she would like to talk about that, primarily in her elbows. She states she has been sitting at the computer more in the office, so she is unsure if it is stagnant in that position all day. She notes her right elbow bothers her more than her left elbow, but she is primarily typing all day versus writing. She denies any other joint pain. She notes occasional numbness and tingling in her hands, which she tries to shake out her arms to relieve the numbness.

She also has a history of gout. Her last episode was about 3 months ago. She had some inflammation of her toe at that time. She denies any other issues with that. She states the medication she was given at that time helped with her gout and she has not seen a flare up since. She reports her psoriasis is under control and has not been a major problem for her either. She is still on colchicine 0.6 mg twice a day as needed for flare-ups of her gout.

[patient] i'm doing okay . um , my osteoarthritis has been flaring up a little bit lately , um , so i wan na get- talk about that primarily . so , it's mostly in um , my elbows and it's really been bothering me . i've been sitting at the computer , at the desk more , um , in the office so i do n't know if it's being stagnant in that position all day has um , increased flare-ups for that , but i wanted to talk to you about that .
[doctor] okay , sure . and , are you right or left-handed ?
[patient] i'm right-handed .
[doctor] okay , and does one elbow bother you more than the other ?
[patient] my right elbow does bother me more than the other , but primarily , i'm typing all day versus writing , so it- it flares up in both .
[doctor] okay . all right , and um , any other joint pain ?
[patient] no , just- just really focused on my elbows .
[doctor] okay , and any numbing or tingling in your hands ?
[patient] uh , sometimes . when i'm typing for long periods of time , i feel a little bit of numbing , um , i try to shake out my arms a little bit . um , just to kind of relieve that um , sensation .
[doctor] okay . all right , and i know that you've had this also , had this history of gout . and the last episode you had was about three months ago . you had some inflammation of your toe . have you had any other issues with that ?
[patient] no , i have n't . um , the medication you gave me really controlled it , and i have n't seen a flare-up since .
[doctor] okay . all right , and how are you doing with your psoriasis ?
[patient] that's been under control too . that has n't been a- a major problem for me either .
[doctor] okay . i- i know that we had given you some clobetasol for your scalp . is that- so that's doing okay ?
[patient] yeah , that's doing a lot better .
[doctor] okay , great . um , all right , well , i'd like to go ahead and do a physical exam on you .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] let's first look at your vital signs . hey , dragon , show me the vital signs . great , so everything looks good from that perspective . um , so looking at you , i do n't appreciate any cervical lymphadenopathy . your heart is a nice regular rate and rhythm , and your lungs sound really clear . on your right elbow , you do have some edema and inflammation of your right olecranon and there's some tenderness and an effusion right there . so um , does that hurt when i press it ?
[patient] yeah , that does hurt .
[doctor] okay , and when i turn your arm , do you have pain ?
[patient] yeah , that hurts a bit too .
[doctor] okay , so she has pain- to palpation of the olecranon bursa and pain with pronation and supination . and when you flex- and when you bend it and straighten it , does that hurt ?
[patient] yeah , it does and it's a bit stiff too .
[doctor] okay , so pain with flexion and extension of the right arm . uh , your abdomen is nice and soft , and there's no lower extremity edema . uh , let's go ahead and take a look at some of your labs . you know , you have a lot of arthritis for someone so young , so we had sent off that autoimmune panel . hey , dragon . show me the autoimmune labs . hey , dragon . show me the autoimmune profile . hey , dragon . show me the esr . okay , so that's good . hey , dragon . show me the uric acid . okay . all right , well , good . that's great . so , you know , it does n't look like you have any systemic arthritis , or sys- systemic inflammatory in process going on . so , my impression of you at this time is that from a gout standpoint , everything is nice and stable . i think that we should continue you on the colchicine 0.6 milligrams twice a day as needed for flare-ups of your gout . um , and then for your osteoarthritis , i'd like to go ahead and order a right elbow x-ray . hey , dragon . order a right elbow x-ray , and then i'd like to prescribe some meloxicam 15 milligrams once a day for the pain and the swelling .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] hey , dragon . order meloxicam 15 milligrams once a day . and then i'd like to um , just see those- how- the x-ray show- shows up and the results of that before we refer you for any type of physical therapy , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and then from a psoriasis standpoint , i think everything is stable . we'll continue you on the steroid cream for your scalp , okay ?
[patient] that sounds good .
[doctor] all right , do you have any questions ?
[patient] no , that's it .
[doctor] all right , take care .
[patient] thank you .

","[doctor] hi , carolyn . how are you ?

[patient] i'm doing okay .
 
[doctor] good . good to see you . i know you're here for followup of your chronic problem . so , i know your osteoarthritis has been flaring up a little lately , and you would like to talk about that ?
 
[patient] yeah , it's been bothering me a little bit more lately . i'm sitting at the computer more in the office , so i'm not sure if it's stagnant in that position all day or if it just bothers me when i sit down . i try to shake out my arms to relieve the numbness and tingling , but it's still bothering me . i do n't know if it bothers my right elbow more than my left elbow , but i'm primarily typing all day , so it bothers me more in my right arm . i would like you to examine my elbows , because i know that's the one that hurts the most , but you know , i'm still on colchicine , and that helps with my gout , and it's not been a major problem for me either . so i'd like to go ahead and do a physical exam . so let's start with your right elbow . how's that doing ? how's your left elbow doing ? what's going on with that ? i know it bothers you a lot more , but do you have any other joint pain or numbness in your hands or fingers or anything like that ? or is it just in your elbows ?
­­­- it's just in my elbows . it's in both of my hands , but my right is bothering me more than the left is . i mean , i think it's because i'm typing more , and i'm at the desk all day . so it's probably in both my hands and my elbows more than it is in my left , but that's what's bothering me the most . i think that's it's mostly in my elbow . i can't really tell you what else is going on in my hands . i've been trying to shake my hands out , but they're still numb . i just can't seem to shake them out . i tried shaking them out , and they still stay numb .
[doctor} okay . and have you had any other issues with your gout ? have you ever had any inflammation of your toe or foot ? i remember you had some inflammation of my toe at that time ."

The patient reports that her left elbow has really been bothering her. She states that she sits at her desk all day for work with her elbows bent. She reports that after work it is really hard for her to flex and extend her left elbow. She reports that it has been really stiff and painful. She also notes that she has noticed swelling on the olecranon of her elbow. She reports that she is right-handed, therefore, she can still write, which is great, but typing is difficult.

Back pain.

HPI:

Ms. Lee is a 40-year-old female who presents today for an evaluation of back pain. She states she was at a birthday party and she ran her back into the railing of the staircase and twisted her back. She denies any pain radiating down her legs. Lying flat and twisting motions aggravate the pain. She is currently taking ibuprofen.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:

Ibuprofen.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:

Anxiety.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:

Lumbar fusion

EXAM

Examination of the back shows range of motion without pain. Straight leg raise is negative. Sensation is intact.

RESULTS

X-rays of the lumbar spine show no obvious signs of acute fracture. Evidence of a prior lumbar fusion with hardware in good position.

IMPRESSION

Lumbar spine strain.

PLAN

At this point, I discussed the diagnosis and treatment options with the patient. I have recommended ice and heat. She will continue with Motrin 800 mg 3 times a day with food. She will follow up with me as needed.
","[doctor] hello mrs. lee , i see you're here for back pain .

[doctor] so it was a surprise for you too ?
[patient] yes it was .
[doctor] very good . okay . so , um , did it hurt because you hit it , or did you twist ? what happened when you ?

[doctor] okay .
[patient] . of jumping up , or something .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] and maybe a twisting .
[doctor] okay . any pain shooting down your legs at all ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] is it on one side or the other of your back ?
[patient] um , it's more on the right .
[doctor] on the right . is there anything that makes it better or worse ?
[patient] uh , if i'm lying flat it hurts a little more , and any twisting motion for sure .
[doctor] okay . all right . and do you have any history or any back problems before ?
[patient] i did . i had a fusion done .
[doctor] okay , yeah that lumbar fusion . um , let's take an x-ray . hey . or let's look at an x-ray . hey dragon , show me the latest x-ray . okay , we can see where you had your fusion , t4 here on the x-ray . but i do n't see anything that looks , um , significantly abnormal . it does n't appear to have any compression fractures or anything like that . so , it's essentially , except for the fusion , a normal exam . let me do your exam for you here . can i have you stand up please ? does it hurt when i twist you that way ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] okay . you can sit back down . if i lift your leg here , does that bother you ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] how 'bout when i lift this leg ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] any pain shooting down your legs when i do that ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] okay . and can you feel me touching down here .
[patient] yes .
[doctor] okay , great . so , you had a injury to your back when you were twisting at the birthday party . you do n't really have any pain or numbness down your legs . you have some stiffness with rotation , um , but you do n't have any evidence of a , um , what we would call a pinched nerved or radiculopathy . so , i think you basically have a strain of your lower back . um , have you been taking any medications ?
[patient] just some ibuprofen .
[doctor] okay . and do you have any other , um , medical problems ?
[patient] um i take medication for anxiety .
[doctor] okay . and that's all ? okay . um , so what we're gon na do is i'm gon na give you , um , just continue the motrin at 800mg , three times a day , with food . i want you to use some ice and heat , alternating on your back . but i do want you walking .

The patient reports that her knee starts hurting after a couple of laps. She notes previously she could swim 10 laps. She denies injury or trauma to the knee.

The patient has a history of chronic back pain that has been intermittent, but right now it has been doing well. She denies pain radiating down her legs.

The patient has a history of depression, which has been going really well with medication and therapy. She is trying to get outside more and it has been helping her with her depression. She notes she is sleeping and eating well. She denies concerns about hurting herself or others.

The patient's carpal tunnel is doing really well. She has been getting full range of motion and it has felt a lot better.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

RESULTS

X-ray of the right knee is unremarkable.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Ms. Thompson is a 27 y.o. female who presents today for evaluation of right knee pain.

Chondromalacia of right patella.
• Medical Reasoning: She has been more active lately but is unaware of any injury to the knee. Her recent x-rays were normal but she did have some discomfort on exam.
• Medical Treatment: Prescribed ibuprofen 600 mg 4 times a day with food. I do want her to do some straight leg raising exercises that will strengthen her quadriceps.
• Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged her to participate in physical activity that is less straining on her joints , such as swimming freestyle laps, or to stop activity all together. If her pain does not improve in a couple of weeks, she will follow up.

Chronic back pain.
• Medical Reasoning: This is stable and well-controlled at this time.
• Medical Treatment: She should continue swimming regularly once her knee is feeling better.

Depression.
• Medical Reasoning: She is doing well with her current regimen.
• Medical Treatment: Continue current medications.

Carpal tunnel syndrome.
• Medical Reasoning: Relatively stable status post carpal tunnel release.
• Medical Treatment: Continue current regimen with no changes at this time.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

[patient] so last week , um , and over the course of the month , i have taken up swimming more regularly .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] i've been trying to get up and get active . and i've- ... all of a sudden i've been feeling some really bad , um , knee pain-
[doctor] okay .
[patient] . in my right knee .
[doctor] just in your right knee ?
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] okay . just when swimming ? are you swimming freestyle with your legs kicking straight or more like breaststroke where your legs kick out ?
[patient] yeah , it's only while swimming. i use the breaststroke so i guess where the legs are kicking out like a frog ... it kinda starts hurting a little bit after i swim a couple laps , which a month ago when i started i was able to do ten .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] but after a couple of laps it starts to hurt .
[doctor] and no injury ? like you did n't fall or twist it or anything like that that you remember ?
[patient] no , not that i can remember .
[doctor] okay . so just swimming a lot and you feeling more and more discomfort ?
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] okay , good . so , um ... i know my nurse did a review of systems before you came in . there were really no significant issues . you have a history of chronic back pain , that's been doing well ?
[patient] yeah , it comes and goes , but right now it's been doing really well .
[doctor] okay , no pain going down your legs or anything like that ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] okay . and i know you have some depression , you've been on medication . how's that been going ?
[patient] that's been going really well .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] with the medication and therapy and then trying to get outside more it's been really helping me .
[doctor] sleeping well ?
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] eating well ? okay . do n't feel any concerns about hurting yourself or others or anything like that ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] okay , good . um , and the , you had ca- carpal tunnel done a few years ago . how's that doing ?
[patient] that's doing-
[doctor] any flare up with that ?
[patient] . that's doing really well . i've been getting full range of motion and it's felt a lot better .
[doctor] okay , great . do you mind if i do a quick exam ?
[patient] yeah , go for it .
[doctor] squeeze my fingers for me . good . okay . is it painful if i move your patella like that ?
[patient] yeah , that hurts .
[doctor] okay . and i'm gon na hold your leg out , i'm gon na hold , i want you to stiffen your upper ... does that hurt when i do that ?
[patient] yeah , that hurts too .
[doctor] okay , good , all right . um , let's take a quick look at your x-ray , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] hey dragon , show me the right knee x-ray . okay , so here's a picture of your right knee . actually normal x-ray , everything looks good , okay ? on my exam , um , you do n't really have any swelling in- in your joints , um , uh , of your knee . you have a little pain with , um , uh , range of motion of the knee . you have real pain when we do what we call patella in- ... patellar inhibition , okay ? so that's what caused most of that pain . so , um , your heart is regular , your lungs are clear , i do n't feel any adenopathy , your thyroid's , um , normal , your grips are equal , the rest of your exam is essentially normal , okay ? so my assessment is , you have what we call chondromalacia of the patella , okay ? it's just from the overuse and all- all the swimming you've been doing , okay ? so , um , to treat that we'll just use some anti-inflammatories , um , go ahead and take some ibuprofen , 600 milligrams four times a day with food . i do want you to do some straight leg raising exercises , that'll strengthen your quadriceps and that'll help with that pain , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] um , basically you want to avoid anything that puts extra pressure on your knees for a little while and it should be fine . if it's not getting any better in a couple weeks i wan na see you again , okay ? so no lunges , avoid the breaststroke . if you're comfortable, you can also do other swimming strokes where your knees are straight instead . or you can take the opportunity to have a little break .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] your second problem is your chronic back pain , that's been doing really well . um , keep swimming , that's okay after this gets better .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] um , but i think , um , i think that's been under control . but if it flares up go ahead and , uh , give me a call , okay ?
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] um , your third problem is your depression . that's been stable . we're gon na keep you on your current medication , not gon na change anything at this point , okay ? and as far as your carpal tunnel goes , that's relatively stable , so , um , uh , no changes there as well . okay ? so anything else i can do for you ?
[patient] no , that's it .

[medicine] okay . all right . and have you noticed any swelling or swelling in your legs or any pain radiating down your legs at all ? or is it just in the knee itself ? or does it go away and then come back ? or do you have any pain in other parts of your body ? or any swelling in other areas of your legs ? or in your feet or ankles or anything like that ? i can't really tell you what happened to your right knee . i just know that it hurts a lot when i swim . i could swim 10 laps , but now i can only do about five or six . i think it hurts after about a couple laps . i would say that's it ."

Abnormal labs.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

The patient is a 31-year-old female with a past medical history significant for type 2 diabetes, and hypertension who presents with abnormal labs. She had an insect bite at her last visit after hiking in the woods. We drew a Lyme titer which came back positive.

The patient reports she has been feeling tired and lacking a lot of energy. She also notes swollen elbow joints, body aches, bullseye rash, and nausea. She states she has not been able to eat much. What she does eat has been bland foods such as crackers. She denies any high fevers.

Regarding her type 2 diabetes, she states her blood sugars have been okay. She notes they are sometimes a little high or low, but nothing too far out of range. She is still taking metformin.

Regarding her hypertension, she is monitoring her blood pressure at home and it has been good. She is avoiding salty foods and is still taking lisinopril.

The patient denies abdominal pain and diarrhea.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

The patient is a 31-year-old female with a past medical history significant for type 2 diabetes, and hypertension who presents with abnormal labs.

Newly diagnosed Lyme disease.
• Medical Reasoning: This is a new issue for her. She presented with an insect bite at her last visit, and her subsequent lyme titer was elevated.
• Medical Treatment: I am going to prescribe doxycycline 100 mg twice a day for 3 weeks. I am going to touch base with an infectious disease doctor to ensure nothing else that needs to be done. I want to see her again next week for follow-up for this.

Hypertension.
• Medical Reasoning: This has been well-controlled based on home monitoring. She has been compliant with dietary modifications including limiting her sodium intake.
• Additional Testing: I am going to order a lipid panel.
• Medical Treatment: She will continue lisinopril 10 mg a day. This was refilled today.
• Patient Education and Counseling: I advised the patient to continue to regularly monitor her blood pressures at home.

Diabetes type 2.
• Medical Reasoning: She has noticed intermittent elevations of her blood glucose levels but has been compliant with the use of metformin. Her diet has been limited due to nausea in the setting of Lyme disease.
• Additional Testing: I am going to order a hemoglobin A1c to ensure no medication changes are needed.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

"CHIEF COMPLAINT

Follow-up for asthma, allergic rhinitis, and food allergy.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Emily Hernandez is a 20-year-old female presenting today for an annual follow-up for asthma, allergic rhinitis, and food allergy. Due to insurance changes during the interim of our last office appointment from 04/2020, she was switched from Symbicort to Wixela. She uses Zyrtec in the spring, summer, and fall for her seasonal allergy symptoms, which tends to work well. She has known peanut and tree nut allergies, which she tries to avoid. She does tolerate almonds and cashew.

Mrs. Hernandez is trying to join the military, who require a certain fitness level without use of a rescue or maintenance inhaler, so she has been weaning off her inhalers. She uses albuterol prior to a run, but otherwise functions without it. She has been reducing her Wixela dose, using 1 inhalation once daily 3 times per week, with remaining days using it twice per day as prescribed. She feels this is working well. She denies urgent care or emergency room visits for respiratory issues in the past year. She denies requiring prednisone for breathing issues in the past year.

She hopes to be enlisted in the military in early spring of 2022. She is currently undergoing exertional testing to this purpose. She explains that this gives hers 6 to 7 months to show that she can exert herself without needing any inhalers.

Over the past year, she admits to vaping and smoking, though she is trying to quit and has cut down her use significantly.

She notes having a nebulizer but denies needing it recently and has only used it in her past for upper respiratory infections and as a child a few times.

Mrs. Hernandez uses Zyrtec during the spring and fall but does not typically have to use it consistently during the summer. She confirms she has been taking Zyrtec 3 days per week when she works outside, and it works well to control her symptoms.

She has been successfully avoiding peanuts. Incident from last year was reviewed where she was exposed to peanuts when she was cleaning an Enterprise rental car that had a lot of peanuts in it. She developed contact hives when the peanuts encountered her skin. Over the past year she denies additional accidental exposures. She wears long sleeves and changes her gloves between each cleaning. She thinks it is likely that she has been in contact with cars that contained peanuts, but due to her protective measures she did not touch them directly. She confirmed she always keeps an EpiPen with her.

The patient is also avoiding tree nuts. She did ingest almonds without issue following our discussion that she could try them. Despite tolerating them well, she continues to avoid all tree nuts.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Asthma.
Allergy rhinitis.
Food allergies to peanut and tree nuts.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Currently smokes tobacco and vapes, trying to reduce and interested in cessation in preparation for joining the army.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Wixela Inhub 250 mcg-50 mcg/dose powder for inhalation. 1 puff 2 times daily in the morning and evening.
Proair HFA as needed.
EpiPen as needed.
Alvesco 80 mcg 2 puff 2 times daily.

ALLERGIES

Peanuts cause a severe, anaphylactic reaction.
Montelukast sodium, “seizure-like” reaction.

RESULTS

Asthma Control Test (ACT) Results: ACT score is 21.
Current food skin test sensitivities include peanuts.

ASSESSMENT

• Moderate persistent asthma, uncomplicated.
• Allergic rhinitis.
• Anaphylactic reaction due to peanuts.

Emily Hernandez is a 20-year-old female who presented today for her yearly follow-up appointment for asthma, allergic rhinitis, and food allergy.

PLAN

Moderate persistent asthma, uncomplicated
The patient has been using Wixela inhaler daily and admits to reducing her daily dose to one puff per day, 3-4 days per week as she feels she does not always need it the full dose. Additionally, she aspires to join the military and she must meet certain physical fitness requirements without the use of her inhaler. I counseled the patient on current asthma treatment guidelines which recommend using Wixela and Alvesco only when needed during periods of illness. The patient agreed to reducing her medicine to Alvesco which is a single medication, versus 2 in Welixa. The patient will continue to use her albuterol inhaler as needed. Her ACT score is 21 today and her spirometry test today was better than it was in 2019, though she recalls that it was smoky from wildfires during her last breathing test.

Allergic rhinitis
She will continue to use Zyrtec as needed, primarily during spring and fall and sometimes in summer. Her current dose cadence is 3 times per week when she works outside. Symptoms are currently under control.

Anaphylactic reaction due to peanuts
The patient has successfully avoided peanuts. Plan is to continue with current methods to avoid exposure. I will refill her EpiPen which expires annually.

INSTRUCTIONS

Moderate persistent asthma, uncomplicated
Start Alvesco, 2 puffs twice daily. Keep Wixela in case Alvesco does not work well. Continue albuterol as needed. Return in 4 months to repeat ACT and spirometry testing.

Allergic rhinitis
Continue Zyrtec 10 mg daily as needed.

Anaphylactic reaction due to peanuts
Continue strict avoidance of peanuts. I will refill her EpiPen today.","[doctor] next patient is emily hernandez . date of birth , march 26 2001 . this is a 20 year old female being seen today for our yearly follow-up for asthma , allergic rhinitis and food allergy . due to insurance changes since our last office appointment in april 2020 , she was switched from symbicort to wixela . she also uses zyrtec in the spring , summer and fall for her seasonal allergy symptoms , which tend to work well . she also has known peanut allergy , she does tolerate almonds and cashews . please put in the asthma section at the very bottom that the act score is 21 . please put under interval history , written consent is obtained today to use dax for documentation .
[doctor] hi emily , how are you ?
[patient] i'm pretty good , how are you ?
[doctor] i'm good , thank you . so gosh , we last talked a little bit over a year ago and it was just a telemedicine visit , but it seems like you've been doing pretty good . i know there was an insurance change . i think you had switched over to wixela , is that right ?
[patient] yep , that's right , and it's what i'm currently using .
[doctor] okay , and that's the 250/50 dose , correct ?
[patient] yes , correct .
[doctor] perfect . so how does that compare ?
[patient] i mean , it's working well . i really have n't had any issues with it and i take it once in the morning and once at night .
[doctor] and that's one puff twice a day ?
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] okay . and have you been having to use your albuterol inhaler at all ?
[patient] rarely , and if i do it's really just before a workout or something out that , if i know i'm really going to be pushing it .
[doctor] so it sounds like it's around strenuous activity .
[patient] yes .
[doctor] okay . so you can do things like go on a walk or going to the grocery store no problem , and just use it for more exertional stuff ?
[patient] yes . like , if i'm gon na go for a run or something like that i'll really just take it before as a preventative .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] and i've been trying to use my daily if i can a little less because i'm trying to go into the military soon .
[doctor] no kidding , that's great .
[patient] yeah , so i have to be able to operate basically at a certain fitness level without an inhaler .
[doctor] really ?
[patient] yeah , and if i can prove that i'm capable of these activities without an inhaler it makes it easier .
[doctor] and so by inhaler do they mean both your daily and rescue inhalers ?
[patient] mm-hmm . so it's like they'll have a fitness test and basically they'll tell me not to take my inhaler that day before the test , and then they'll see how the asthma affects me . and they're looking to see if it's serious enough to hold me back from joining or whatever . so i have been taking it less and less . and really some days i feel like i do n't need it .
[doctor] and that is the wixela that you're not taking . so on average per week , how many days of the week do you use one puff in the morning and one puff at night ?
[patient] probably about three or four .
[doctor] okay , three to four days per week and the other days it's once a day ?
[patient] yes , that's correct .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] and it's either in the morning or at night that i'm taking it .
[doctor] okay , and do you think that's working okay ?
[patient] i do .
[doctor] great . and any urgent care or er visits at all for breathing over the past year ?
[patient] nope .
[doctor] okay , so i'm going to assume no one has put you on prednisone for breathing issues then .
[patient] nope .
[doctor] okay . and now , military wise , what's the time frame of when you'll be completing some of these exertional tests ? like , what are your next steps ?
[patient] so , hopefully i'm going to be enlisted early spring of 2022 . so that gives me about six to seven months to get to a point where i'm able to exert my body where i do n't really need the inhaler . or at least show them that i have it under control .
[doctor] now when you were in the other room you completed a breathing test , correct ?
[patient] correct .
[doctor] okay , great . so now let me ask you about the allergies , 'cause i know typically you'll use the zyrtec in the spring , summer and fall , correct ?
[patient] yeah , i do n't really ... um , or i'm sorry , i use it more during the spring and fall . i do n't really have to use it too much in the summer .
[doctor] do you use it more just as needed in the summer ?
[patient] yeah , that's right .
[doctor] okay . and have you been taking the zyrtec every day recently since you're right in the mix of spring ?
[patient] not every day , but i do take it on days i know i'm going to be outside a lot . um , i do tend to work outside about three days a week so i'll definitely take it on those days .
[doctor] and does it seem to work pretty well still ? are you happy with it ?
[patient] yeah , it does , it works great .
[doctor] wonderful , good to hear . and then i'm assuming you're staying away from the peanuts . uh , last year you had told me it worked with ... uh , you worked with enterprise rent-a-car and one of the cars had a lot of peanuts in it that you were cleaning out and that gave you hives , uh , when you had touched it , is that correct ?
[patient] yep , that's correct .
[doctor] okay . and has there been anything like that since that experience ?
[patient] no , i do n't think so . i definitely became more cautious after that , so i usually wear , uh , wear long sleeves and change my gloves every time now . so i have n't had a reaction , but i imagine that i probably came into contact with cars that had peanuts in them , but they just d- did n't touch my skin .
[doctor] super . and it sounds like you're really smart about it .
[patient] yeah , and the airplanes , they have peanuts . they give everyone too , so .
[doctor] okay . and you have an epipen that k- that you keep with you , correct ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] okay . and i'm assuming you're going to need refills , um , i can call you in a new set for the year . typically of course , they expire within a year .
[patient] yeah , okay .
[doctor] and i remember , um , sometime previously you've had some testing for tree nuts , but you do have almonds and cashews , correct ? and- and you do okay with them , or do you avoid all tree nuts ?
[patient] i do tend to avoid all of them but i recall eating some almonds at one point , uh , really soon after we discussed i might not be allergic to tree nuts anymore .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] and i remember having them and nothing happened , but i usually just tend to stay away from them , um , really if i can help it .
[doctor] okay . so sometimes when people have a peanut allergy , the nuts in general just are n't very important to them , so it is very common to avoid both . um , so let's do this . i'll have helen come in and i would love to complete a breathing test on you . if your breathing numbers are looking great we can work on getting you , uh , something lower than wixela . if you look at all of our asthma regimens it is a stepwise process , and wixela is a combination of two medications in one . and , well maybe you do n't need both of'em . uh , maybe you just need one of'em . so we can work our way backwards .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and so the breathing test will help give us some- some more guidance , we will look at the results in just a moment .
[patient] all right , and so this past year i did get into the bad habit of vaping and smoking , but i have been trying to cut that out . so i should be good , and , um , now i only do just a little bit and i am trying to quit . so i am sure that might have an effect .
[doctor] it can . um , so what we can do today is compare your results with prior results , probably before you started smoking or using the vape .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] yeah . and we'll see where you stand at that point .
[patient] all right , that sounds good .
[doctor] well let me go ahead and listen , so hop on up here for me .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right so your ears look good , a little bit of wax on both sides . can i see inside your mouth ? big ahh .
[patient] ahh .
[doctor] good . okay let me take a peek in your nose . all right , good . you can put your mask back on .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and go ahead take a big breath in and out . good , your lungs sound terrific . i'll listen to your heart , breathe quietly . okay very good .
[patient] awesome .
[doctor] so your breathing test is about the same as it was a couple years ago , and actually looks a little bit better . you may not remember but when we last completed the test in 2019 , uh , do you recall if you were feeling lousy at the time ?
[patient] i think it was the smoke . there were so many fires at that point and i remember coming in and looking out the window and all you saw was the orange and the smoke .
[doctor] yes , you're absolutely right , that was a bad year . that was my first fall here and i was really alarmed . well that explains why at that time your numbers were a little bit lower and today they look better . here's what i think , so you'll have kaiser currently , correct ?
[patient] correct .
[doctor] okay . most insurances do limit what we can use .
[patient] yeah i do know that .
[doctor] okay so option one would be to continue using wixela like you're using it now . we would classify it as off-label and you can use it once a day instead of twice a day , which is fine . some people do that because they just need it once a day , so that's an option . option two would be to actually back up to an inhaler that just has one med .
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] so the one that kaiser covers is alvesco . the thing about alvesco , though , is that it would be two puffs in the morning and two puffs at night . so it's a bit more work . um , it's not breath activated but we could step down the lowest dose to see how you do . some of the newer guidelines for asthma that were published this year is recommending trying to treat people with inhalers like wixela or alvesco only when you're ill , or say during smoke season . so minimizing their use to those periods of time versus all year . unless you found out that you're getting
[ inaudible 00:09:25 ] sick having issues every month , then that would indicate would pull back too much .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] that we had too much , yeah .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] um , so we could step back and possibly get you to the point where you just use those inhalers , uh , when you're ill or it's smoke season , but at the first step to do any of that would be to try to drop down to just alvesco .
[patient] okay , that actually sounds really good .
[doctor] okay great . so i will call that in for you , it will be the lower dose , 80 mcg , and you'll have to do two puffs twice a day .
[patient] all right
[doctor] okay and that'll be on the box when i call it in . you can put the wixela off to the side , but do n't throw it away just in case the alvesco does n't work well for you .
[patient] okay , got it .
[doctor] and then ideally we would repeat your breathing test in four months to see how you're doing , and then be able to document that you're doing well . sometimes , not always , the military will require documentation on breathing tests .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] is your pharmacy still the same or did you update it with helen ?
[patient] yeah i believe she updated it . it should be kaiser permanente broadway .
[doctor] okay perfect . i'll make sure it's the alvesco and then i'll renew your albuterol and epipen as well .
[patient] awesome , thank you .
[doctor] you're welcome . uh , then the zyrtec , do you pick it up over the counter or do get- do you get it as a prescription ?
[patient] i just get it over the counter .
[doctor] okay got it . and do you have a nebulizer that you would , uh , need refills on ?
[patient] i do n't think i need any refills , i have n't used that in such a long time . i think the last time was when i had bronchitis , or there was few select times when i had to use it when i was kid .
[doctor] okay good . well i think we have our game plan .
[patient] okay awesome .
[doctor] and do the alvesco two puffs twice a day and your albuterol if you need it . the zyrtec 10 milligrams as you need it and continue to stay away from peanuts and tree nuts and i'll refill your epipen .
[patient] okay
[doctor] all right so we've got it .
[patient] great .
[doctor] all right i'll have you take this to the front and i'm gon na say four months re-check for asthma and we'll repeat the spirometer- spirometry at that time .
[patient] okay sounds good .
[doctor] all right well thanks so much and you have a great day .
[patient] you too .
[doctor] and we'll do a follow-up in four months with act and spirometry , sooner if needed . follow-up 25 minutes .","[doctor] hi , emily . how are you ?

[patient] i'm doing okay .
[doctor ] good . i'm glad to see you . so , i know you're here for an annual follow-up for asthma , allergic rhinitis , and food allergy . how have you been doing since last year's visit ? i know that you were switched from Symbicort to wixela . what's going on with your inhaler , and what dose are you using ?
Mrs. Hernandez is trying to join the military , who require a certain fitness level without use of a rescue or maintenance inhaler, so she has been weaning off her inhalers.

"CHIEF COMPLAINT

High blood pressure and palpitations.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Jordan Roberts is a 49-year-old with a long history of hypertension and an acute episode of palpitations.

In March, Mr. Roberts went to the emergency room for palpitations and hypertension. He attributed this to a panic attack, but also stated he consumed several cups of coffee on an empty stomach the morning of. He denies additional episodes of palpitations.

He has been monitoring his blood pressure at home daily, obtaining systolic blood pressure readings of 146 to 155. He does report a family history of hypertension. Additionally, he has been monitoring his salt intake and feels he is doing well at reducing it. He also walks on his treadmill as often as he can.

He has a new primary care physician who started him on a new medication Benicar HCT, which he has been using for the past month.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Hypertension.

FAMILY HISTORY

Several family members positive for hypertension.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Benicar HCT 40 mg/25 mg
Amlodipine 10 mg daily.

Physical Examination

Cardiovascular
Normal rate, regular rhythm, S2 normal, normal heart sounds, and normal pulses.

Pulmonary/Chest
Breath sounds normal. 

Abdominal
There is no tenderness.

Musculoskeletal
There is no edema.

RESULTS

Thyroid profile 03/01/2021.

ASSESSMENT

• Resistant hypertension.

Mr. Roberts presents with resistant hypertension, with systolic blood pressure readings between 146-155. He is currently on maximal doses for 3 medications.

PLAN

I have added spironolactone to his regimen which will require monitoring of his potassium and sodium. We will schedule him for a follow up in 2 weeks to complete a basic metabolic panel and check his blood pressure. Next medication to consider adding is carvedilol. I have tried to avoid this, given the potential for issues with erectile dysfunction. I counseled the patient about spironolactone side effects, including gynecomastia and electrolyte disturbances, as well as his increased risk of dehydration, with one sign to watch for being dizziness. If we are not able to improve his blood pressure with spironolactone, the next step would be sending him to the resistant hypertension clinic.

I provided and reviewed with Mr. Roberts the American Heart association website (heart.org) and encouraged him to access for tips on lowering his salt intake and increasing his potassium intake. His maximum salt intake should be 1500 to <2000 mg per day. He was provided materials to follow the DASH diet and encouraged to meet 30-min of walking most days.

INSTRUCTIONS

Schedule follow up appointment in 2 weeks for blood pressure check and basic metabolic panel. Reduce sodium intake to 1500 to <2000 mg per day. Follow DASH diet.

[doctor] uh , can you tell me which medications you're taking ?
[patient] my new med is , uh , a combo med , something 40-25 .
[doctor] okay . um . yes , i see that in your chart . the benicar hct . it has hydrochlorothiazide in it .
[patient] yeah , that's it . my water pill i call it .
[doctor] okay . are you still taking the amlodipine , 10 milligrams daily ?
[patient] uh , yes i am .
[doctor] that's- that's a good start on a regimen . are you checking your blood pressure at home , and if yes , what numbers are you seeing ?
[patient] um , every day .
[doctor] awesome .
[patient] yeah . every morning , i take it when i get up , and it's been running at about , uh , 146 to 155 lately .
[doctor] so you're not down in the 120s yet ?
[patient] no , not yet . well , we're trying to get there though .
[doctor] okay . uh , how are you doing with your salt intake ?
[patient] i'm trying to back off of it . i think i'm doing good with it , not eating too much .
[doctor] good , uh , it plays a huge part in lowering your pressure and , uh , staying away from salt is important . um , i'll give you some information on the dash eating plan , which is the only eating plan that has been shown to lower blood pressure .
[patient] sounds good .
[doctor] are you doing any exercise ?
[patient] i do try to walk on the treadmill when i can .
[doctor] okay , great . um , all right . so , let's take a look .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] uh , you're gon na hear me talk throughout your exam , just so i can make sure i get everything documented .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so , use my general physical exam template . let me take a listen to you and make sure everything sounds good .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] your heart and lungs sound good , so that's great .
[patient] good to hear .
[doctor] all right . go ahead and lie down . uh , and let me know if anywhere i press hurts .
[patient] nope . nowhere .
[doctor] all right . so , i'm gon na take a look at your ankles and feet . i'm just gon na look for some swelling .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] all right . it all looks good . go ahead and sit up . so , in terms of getting that pressure down , you're on three meds that are maxed out and your blood pressure is still not down . and , the question is what do we need to do to get your- to get it down . uh , your potassium one week ago was 4.0 . uh , has it been redone since in the last week ?
[patient] uh , no .
[doctor] okay . uh , four is good for your potassium level , some people have what is called resistant hypertension that is driven by something else in their body , uh , often it is a form , uh , hormonal response . if i were to take 10 people under the age of 50 who have high blood pressure who developed it at a young age , eight out of 10 would respond to reduced salt in their diet with a lower blood pressure . but , for the two out of 10 , there is something else driving it , uh , parathyroid levels or something called your adrenal glands overproduce , um , aldosterone , which we call hyperaldosterone .
[patient] okay . so , is there something we can do about it ?
[doctor] um , in these cases , there's medicine called , uh , spironolactone , that is very effective at dropping the ald- aldosterone level , and your blood pressure , and i think we should give that a try .
[patient] all right . i mean , i'm willing to give it a try .
[doctor] okay . so , let's discuss the piss- the possible risk of , uh , being on hydrochlorothiazide , which is the fluid med that you're now on . and , the spironolactone . one issue is that they can affect your electrolyte balance . um , they can also cause dehydration . so , when ... so , you got ta make sure that you hydrate . if you do not hydrate , and you get dehydrated , you will know it because you will get dizzy standing up . um , second thing is the spironolactone can raise your potassium too far , it's rare , but it can . uh , you're starting with your potassium at four , so that gives us some room .
[patient] all right . i guess that makes me feel a little bit better .
[doctor] yeah . and then the third thing is that spironolactone combined with hydrocholorozide- chlorothiazide can cause your sodium levels to go down . now , this does not mean- mean that you need to be eating more salt , okay ? but , it does mean that you will need to do blood tests in two weeks to make sure that it's okay .
[patient] all right . no , that i can do . um , are there any other side effects i need to worry about ?
[doctor] uh , dizziness possibly , as well as , uh , one in 100 guys might develop tenderness in their chest , swollen breasts , or enlarged breasts . this is a rare side effect , um , called gynecomastia , and if it happens , you just cut the medication and you let me know , but it is very uncommon .
[patient] i'll definitely let you know if that happens .
[doctor] okay . uh , we'll keep working at it until your blood pressure gets better . um , it can be tricky when your blood pressure starts to go up at a young age though , it is important to get it under control because it can lead to your heart getting bigger or enlarged . um , same thing that happens when you lift weights and your muscles get bigger , uh , and if your heart pumps against high blood pressure , it can eventually lead to heart failure .
[patient] i understand .
[doctor] yeah , so getting that under control is really important to help prevent kidney failure , strokes , and- and things like that- that you're at high risk for with high blood pressure .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] um , the american heart association has a website called heart.org , it has a lot of really good information about blood pressure to teach- to teach you about it and how to control your diet with exercise . um , if you do your treadmill routinely for 30 minutes or so most days , that could be seven to 10 points off your blood pressure .
[patient] really ? i did n't realize that .
[doctor] yeah , yeah . it's very important to be active , lower your salt , and increase your potassium . um , the goal is to keep your salt under 2000 milligrams a day , the actual recommendation is- is 1500 milligrams per day , but most people have a hard time with that . um , so just take a look at the website and the dash diet information . um , that will give you a lot of tips and information to help you start learning about this stuff .
[patient] okay . i'll definitely check that out .
[doctor] all right . so , we'll try the spironolactone and schedule a followup in two weeks to check your blood pressure and electrolytes . uh , if the new med does n't work , the next up is going to be the resistant hypertension clinic .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] all right . so , there they will look into secondary causes of your hypertension . they have access to newer procedure based technologies that can lower your blood pressure without medication , uh , for example , there is something called a renal , uh , denervation , uh , where they go inside the artery that feeds your kidney with almost like a little coil and heat that artery up . when they do that , they can block the nerve endings that get into your kidneys and lower your blood pressure .
[patient] that's interesting .
[doctor] yeah . so , that procedure has been shown to lower blood pressure by 10 points . um , there are of course some risks , so not everyone is a candidate . uh , but we'll cross that road , uh , when we need to , and let's just- let's just see how you do with the addition of the medication .
[patient] sounds good to me .
[doctor] all right . so , we will see you in two weeks then .
[patient] sounds good . thanks doc .
[doctor] yeah , you're welcome . let me know if you have any questions .
[patient] will do .
[doctor] all right . have a great day mr. roberts .
[patient] you too .
[doctor] mr. roberts presents with resistant hypertension . he's on three meds and maximum dose . i have added spironolactone to his regiment . we will need to monitor his potassium and sodium . he will have a metabolic panel and blood pressure check in two weeks . uh , next medication would be carvedilol , uh , which i try to avoid giving , it's potential for erectile dysfunction . i have talked to the patient about that , and the potential side effects of spironolactone , including the gynecomastia and electrolyte disturbances . if he is not controlled on spironolactone , the next step would be sending him to resistant hypertension clinic .","[doctor] hi , jordan . how are you ?

[patient] i'm doing okay .
[chief] good . i'm glad to hear you're doing well . i know you've been having some problems with your blood pressure . so , how have you been doing with that ? i know that you went to the emergency room in march for some high blood pressure and palpitations . so tell me a little bit about that episode . how did that happen ? how were you able to get through it ? i heard you had a panic attack and you drank several cups of coffee on an empty stomach the morning of the episode .
 
[doctor] okay . and did you have any other episodes of high blood pressures ?
 
[patient] no , not really . i've been monitoring my blood pressure at home daily , obtaining systolic blood pressure readings of 146 to 155 . i feel like i've done a pretty good job of keeping it under control . i try to stay away from salt , but i'm not doing a great job at it .
(doctor) okay . i see . and have you taken any other medications for your hypertension ? have you tried any medications for that problem ? i mean , you know , other than the medications that you're on now ? i do know that your primary care physician started you on a new medication Benicar hCT , which you've actually been using for the past month .
­[patient ] yeah . i do n't know if that helped at all , but it's been helping a lot . i have been watching my salt intake as well , and i think we're doing pretty well at reducing it . i also try to walk on my treadmill as often as i can , and that helps a lot too . i think that's the biggest thing that's helped me with my hypertension . i just try to keep my blood sugars under control , and keep my sodium and potassium under control as well . so far , so good . so i guess that's all that's going on with your health . i'll let you know if anything else comes up . i'd love to hear from you about that . i want to make sure you're taking your medications as prescribed . so let's get started with your physical exam . so, let's go ahead and do a quick physical exam , and then we'll go over your medical history . let's start with your thyroid profile . how is your thyroid doing ? how are your levels ? how's your heart rate ?"
"CHIEF COMPLAINT

Follow up irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Ms. Brittany Edwards is a pleasant 32-year-old female who returns in follow up for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with functional abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.

Ms. Edwards was last seen in August 2019 with flares of abdominal pain and was diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome that was treated with Bentyl. She had a previous prescription for Reglan that she received from the emergency room that she used as needed for nausea. She was instructed to start a low dose fiber supplement such as Citrucel daily, probiotics to help with gas and bloating, and Bentyl up to 4 times daily for intestinal cramping. She was instructed to discontinue Reglan and to use Zofran as needed for nausea. Neuromodulators such as Elavil and Buspar were discussed but not started.

Ms. Edwards continues to have intermittent abdominal symptoms. Monday through Thursday she has less flare ups of her symptoms but states she is currently having cramps and sharp pains. She describes she recently ate shrimp which caused her to have both upper and lower abdominal pain and bloating. However, she notices episodes of diarrhea after eating chicken alfredo and consuming alcohol. She does not believe the alfredo contributes to her symptoms. The patient states she consumes 2 drinks when out of either tequila or brown liquor and occasionally a martini. She does her best to avoid “heavy foods,” but ate fried chicken today without any symptoms. She has stopped drinking sodas which has been helpful. The patient reports passing 2-3 formed stools a day.

REVIEW OF SYMPTOMS

• Gastrointestinal: Positive nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal pain.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Alert and cooperative, appears stated age.

Respiratory
Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.

Cardiovascular
Heart regular rate and rhythm.

Gastrointestinal
Abdomen soft, non-tender, no masses or organomegaly. Normoactive bowel sounds.

ASSESSMENT

• Irritable bowel syndrome

Brittany Edwards is a 32-year-old established patient who returned today to discuss management of IBS and functional abdominal pain made worse by high stress, poor eating habits, and poor sleeping habits.

PLAN

I have encouraged dietary and lifestyle modifications as well as starting a neuromodulator, such as Elavil 25 mg at bedtime for IBS. She can use Bentyl 20 mg as needed 30-45 minutes before eating out at a restaurant. She can also use Zofran as needed for nausea. However, I have encouraged her to reduce greasy fatty foods and alcohol consumption.

INSTRUCTIONS

Send MyChart message in 1 month regarding any side effects of issues with Elavil or if dose adjustments are needed.
Return to clinic in 1 month or sooner if needed.","[doctor] brittany edwards , 07 , 1898 . she is a return visit for ibs with functional abdominal pain , nausea , vomiting . ms. edwards is a pleasant , 32-year-old female who was last seen in august of 2019 with flares of abdominal pain , who was diagnosed with irritable bowl that was treated with bentyl .

[doctor] hello , how are you ?
[patient] i'm okay .
[doctor] good . how have you been feeling ?
[patient] not so good .
[doctor] yeah , so my nurse told me you have been going out to eat some on friday nights and saturday nights and that you have had some spicy foods or spicy shrimp .
[patient] yeah , i have .
[doctor] okay . well , your gut probably does not always appreciate that .
[patient] no , it does n't like it at all .
[doctor] yeah , so ibs is one of those things where you are very sensitive to certain things such as spicy foods or fatty foods and alcohol . and this can cause lower belly stuff like cramps , or you can get upper belly stuff such as nausea .
[patient] i've been getting both .
[doctor] okay . um , so how frequently have you been getting or having a bowel movement on normal days ?
[patient] i'm starting to notice it's between two and three times a day .
[doctor] okay . and are they soft stools or formed stools ?
[patient] um , they're formed .
[doctor] okay . and after you have gone out either drinking with your friends , do you tend to have more diarrhea ?
[patient] yeah , i do .
[doctor] okay . do you feel it's the food or the alcohol or both ?
[patient] uh , well usually we go to friday's restaurant . i always eat pasta , the chicken alfredo .
[doctor] okay . i can s- i can bet it's the alfredo sauce .
[patient] but it normally does n't bother me .
[doctor] okay . well , pasta can make you bloated , uh , but it does n't usually cause diarrhea . grilled chi- uh , grilled chicken is usually all right . alfredo , though , is higher in fat , and it does contain dairy . but you're saying it usually does n't bother you ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] okay . what type of alcohol drink do you drink when you are there ? is it a sweet drink ?
[patient] most of the time it's either tequila or dark liquor . i prefer patron , but if i get brown liquor , i only get two . um , every now and again , i'll drink a martini .
[doctor] sometimes it's the mixer they tend to put in the drinks , but it can be a variety of things . um , so when you're not eating out or drinking , what we do on a daily basis does help keep us regular , so when it does flare up , it c- it might not be as bad . um , have you had any luck using the fiber like citrucel regularly ?
[patient] um , no . i guess i need to find a new drink .
[doctor] okay . and how is it during the week ?
[patient] like what i eat ?
[doctor] yeah , and with the diarrhea and abdomal- um , abdominal pain .
[patient] right now , i'm still having the cramping and sharp pains , so i've been avoiding heavy foods . i did have some fried chicken today , though .
[doctor] and was everything all right after that ?
[patient] yeah , for the most part .
[doctor] okay . remember , it's also the portion sizes . so i mean , if you eat a little and you feel fine , then that's okay . you have to just really watch the portions .
[patient] okay , good . i ca n't go out- go without some fried chicken at least once in a while .
[doctor] sounds good . all right , well let's take a look at you today , and we'll do a brief physical exam . you will hear me call out some findings . i will answer any questions , and we will discuss once we have finished the exam .
[patient] sounds good .
[doctor] all right . so the patient is alert and cooperative , appears stated age . all right . i'm going to listen to your heart and lungs . and lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally . heart regular rate and rhythm . all right , so if you could just lay back for me , and i'll examine your abdomen .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right . do you have any tenderness ?
[patient] no , not really .
[doctor] okay . so the abdomen is soft , non-tender . no masses or organomegaly . and let me take a listen . normal active bowel sounds . all right . you can go ahead and sit up now . thank you .
[doctor] all right , so first i want you to try citrucel . it does come in a tablet . you should use it twice daily for regularity . then i would say , if you know you're going out and will possibly have diarrhea as a result , you can go ahead and use your bentyl 20 milligrams . you can do one tablet before you eat , and then repeat up to four times daily . and then on days when you feel good , you do n't have to use anything . um , and then on friday before you leave the house , you can take a bentyl and put one in your pocket for later , and then you can repeat the same thing on saturday if you want , and that will be totally fine .
[patient] okay , that sounds good .
[doctor] okay . and so your bentyl , that's the anti-spasm medication , and i would take the higher dose .
[patient] can i get a refill of that ?
[doctor] yes , absolutely . uh , so take one tablet about 30 to 45 minutes before leaving the house and then the second tablet at the restaurant . then with the nausea , um , i think we should try and see if you can recognize a pattern with what you are eating and drinking , um , um , about , like , what makes it worse .
[patient] yeah , i noticed i've been doing better with drinking water instead of sodas .
[doctor] okay , good . and then for your zofran , i would n't take that ahead of time . just plan on drinking plenty of water .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] okay , and you can take it , but before you do , we want to try to reduce the triggers . uh , so watch out for greasy or fatty foods and sugary drinks .
[patient] okay , i can do that .
[doctor] okay . and so , however , if it is not just these isolated inci- incidents and the symptoms are happening all the time , we could put you on a long term medication that would take ... that you would take every night . and so then you do n't have to use so much bentyl or the zofran . how do you feel about that ?
[patient] i was actually going to ask you about something like that to help avoid flares altogether .
[doctor] yeah , there is . and it actually works on the chemicals in your brain that are causing your gut to be overly sensitive . one is called elavil , but the only drawback is that it can make you a little sleepy . how does that sound ?
[patient] that sounds like a much better plan .
[doctor] okay , great . we can definitely do that . uh , just take it every night before bedtime .
[patient] okay , that sounds good . thank you so much .
[doctor] you're welcome . and so i have gone ahead and sent your prescriptions to your pharmacy . just give us a call if you have any questions or need us for anything else . and then let's plan on touching base through mychart email in about a month to just check in to see how you're doing with symptoms . okay ?
[patient] okay , that sounds good . thank you .
[doctor] you're welcome , and have a good rest of your day .

Follow up adult hydrocephalus, 3 months status post shunt surgery.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Mr. Christopher Watson is an 86-year-old male who returns in follow up of adult hydrocephalus. This is his first visit since undergoing shunt surgery 08/01/2020. He is accompanied by his daughter, Theresa, together they give his history.

I have followed Mr. Watson since May 2020. He presented with 8-10 years of progressive gait impairment, cognitive impairment, and decreased bladder control. We established a diagnosis of adult hydrocephalus with the spinal catheter protocol in June 2020 and he underwent shunt surgery on 08/01/2020. A Medtronic Strata programmable shunt in the ventriculoperitoneal configuration programmed at level 2.0 was placed.

Mr. Watson has had no hospitalizations or other illnesses since I last saw him. With respect to his walking, his daughter states that he is now able to walk to the dining room just fine but could not before his surgery. His balance has improved though he still has some walking impairment. With respect to his bladder control, initially there was some improvement, but he has leveled off and he wears a diaper. With respect to his cognition, both Theresa and the patient say that his thinking has improved. The other daughter, Hannah summarized it best according to the two of them, she said “I feel like I can have a normal conversation with him again.” Mr. Watson has had no headaches and no pain at the shunt site or in the abdomen.

PAST HISTORY

Urinary incontinence.
Adult hydrocephalus.
Gait impairment.
Cognitive impairment.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

• Constitutional Symptoms: Significant for impaired ability to carry out daily functions. Negative for fever or unintentional weight loss.
• Genitourinary: Significant for urinary incontinence and wearing a diaper. Negative for genital sores, decreased or painful output.
• Neurological: Significant for continued walking impairment and cognitive impairment. Negative for headaches, recent falls, or hallucinations.
• Psychiatric: Negative for depression, excessive worrying, or mood swings.

VITALS

Blood pressure 124/80, heart rate is 64, respiratory rate is 18, weight 174 pounds, and pain is 0/10.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Constitutional
Mr. Watson is a pleasant and cooperative man who is able to converse easily though his daughter adds some details.

Head and Face
The shunt site was clean, dry, and intact and confirmed at a setting of 2.0.

Neurological
Mental status: Tested for recent and remote memory, attention span, concentration, and fund of knowledge. He scored 26/30 on the MMSE when tested with spelling and 25/30 when tested with calculations. Of note, he was able to get two of the three memory words with cuing and the third one with multiple choice. This was a slight improvement over his initial score of 23/30 with calculations and 24/30 with spelling and at that time he was unable to remember any memory words with cuing and only one with multiple choice.
Gait: Tested using the Tinetti assessment tool. He was tested without an assistive device and received a gait score of 6-8/12 and a balance of score of 12/16 for a total score of 18-20/28. This has slightly improved from his initial score of 15-17/28.
Cranial Nerves: Pupils are equal. Extraocular movements are intact. Face symmetric. No dysarthria.
Motor: Normal for bulk and strength.
Coordination: Slow for finger-to-nose.

RESULTS

CT scan of the head from 10/15/2020: It shows a frontal horn span at the level of foramen of Munro of 4.6 cm with a 3rd ventricular contour that is flat with the span of 10 mm. By my reading, there is a tiny amount of blood in the right frontal region with just a tiny subdural collection. This was not noticed by the radiologist who stated no extra axial fluid collections. There is also substantial small vessel ischemic change.

ASSESSMENT

• Adult hydrocephalus.
• Gait impairment.
• Urinary incontinence and urgency.
• Cognitive impairment.

Mr. Watson has made some improvement with his hydrocephalus since shunt surgery. There is a tiny fluid collection in the right parietal region. I do not believe that this tiny amount of fluid is symptomatic, and it was not documented by the radiologist when he read the CT scan.

Mr. Watson asked me about whether he will be able to drive again. Unfortunately, I think it is unlikely that his speed of movement will improve to a level that he will be able to pass a driver's safety evaluation, however, occasionally patients surprise me by improving enough over 9 to 12 months that they are able to pass such a test. I would certainly be happy to recommend such a test if I believe he is likely to pass it and he is always welcome to enroll in a driver's safety program without my recommendation, however, I think it is exceeding unlikely that he has the capability of passing this rigorous test at this time. I also think it is quite likely he will not regain sufficient speed of motion to pass such a test.

PLAN

I had a long discussion with the patient and his daughter. We are all pleased that he has started to make some improvement with his hydrocephalus because of the fluid collection in the right parietal region, I would like to leave the setting at 2.0 for another three months before we consider changing the shunt.

INSTRUCTIONS

Follow up in 3 months.","[doctor] okay , so our next patient is christopher watson . date of birth 04/12/1934 . mr . watson is- is an 86-year-old male who returns in follow-up for adult hydrocephalus . this is his first visit since undergoing sh- shunt surgery , excuse me , on august 1st , 2020 .
[doctor] i have followed mr . watson since may of 2020 when he first presented with eight to ten years of progressive gait impairment , cognitive impairment , and decreased bladder control . we established a diagnosis of adult hydrocephalus with a spino catheter protocol in june 2020 , and he underwent shunt surgery on august 1st , 2020 . a medtronic strata programmable shunt in the ventricular peritoneal configuration was programmed at a level 2.0 was placed .
[doctor] good morning , mr . watson , who is the nice lady you have with you today ?
[patient] hi , doc . this is my daughter , theresa . she is the one who helps me keep things straight .
[doctor] mr . watson , have you been sick or been hosp -- hospitalized since your shu- shunt surgery three months ago .
[patient] uh , not that i recall .
[patient_guest] no , he has n't . he has been doing much better .
[doctor] good , i'm glad to hear that .
[doctor] before surgery , you were having some progressive problems that affected your walking , thinking , and bladder control . are these symptoms better , worse , or unchanged ?
[patient_guest] his walking has improved . he's now able to walk to the dining room just fine . but he could not do that before surgery . he still has times where i have to help him .
[doctor] that's impressive , mr . watson .
[patient] yeah , i guess .
[patient_guest] now his bladder control did improve some after surgery , but now seems to have leveled out . so he is wearing diapers .
[doctor] no issues with sores from wearing the diaper ? and any decreased or painful urination ?
[patient_guest] no , not at all .
[doctor] and how about cognition ?
[patient] i think i'm better . i do n't feel lost when talking to someone anymore .
[patient_guest] dad and i both think my sister , hannah , summarized it best . she said "" i feel like i can have a normal conversation with him again , ""
[doctor] that's so wonderful ! now have you had any headaches or pain where the shunt is ?
[patient] no . has n't bothered me one bit .
[doctor] okay . and any pain in your belly at all ?
[patient] ca n't say that i have .
[doctor] okay , sounds like you have been improving . alrighty , mr . watson , i'm going to step out of the room while my resident comes in to do a few tests for me . is that all right ?
[patient] sounds good .
[doctor] okay , i'm going to go out and review the ct scan you had last month , and then we'll chat about it when i come in .
[doctor] all righty , mr . watson , so you definitely have made some improvements since the shunt surgery . now on ct scan though i do believe i see a tiny bit of blood fluid collection in the right parietal region . now , i do n't believe that that's causing any symptoms , and i , it actually was n't documented by the radiologist when he read the ct scan .
[patient] so what does that mean ?
[doctor] just that i would like to leave the shunt set for another two to three months before we go in changing it . like i said , if you're not having any headaches or pain and you have improved so that's all good for me . so really there's , there's nothing to worry about .
[patient] all right so i'll come back in three months ?
[doctor] yep , that's right .
[patient] i do have a question for you though .
[doctor] yeah , of course .
[patient] do you think i will be able to drive again ?
[doctor] ah man , mr . watson , i knew you were gon na ask me that one . i think at this point it's unlikely that your movement speed will improve to the level that would be needed for you to pass the driver safety evaluation . now , i will say that i do occasionally have patients who surprise me by improving over a nine to 12 month range . and that , that definitely could be you . you could definitely pass it at that point . so if you improve and we can continue to talk about that then , ya know , i think it could be possible , um , and i'd be happy to recommend it .
[doctor] now , you could definitely also enroll in a driver safety program without my recommendation . so you could kind of do that preemptively , and then we could continue to watch for your improvement as we go .
[patient] okay . i kinda figured that anyway but i just thought i'd ask . i do n't like to burden anyone when i just need to run to the store but i also know that i need to be safe .
[doctor] yeah , your safety is our number one priority and , ya know , i'm sure your daughters do n't mind as much , right , they want to keep you here and have you safe . but , i overall am very pleased with how much you have improved . and so , i'm sure when we talk again in three months , we'll continue to be on that upward trajectory or improvement .
[patient] i sure hope so , doc .
[patient_guest] we really appreciate all that you've done . do we make the appointment out front ?
[doctor] yeah , that would be great . the girls up front will take care of you and get you settled for three months from now , and you both take care , all right ?
[patient] thanks
[patient_guest] thank you .
[doctor] all righty , so ros is constitutional significant for impaired ability to carry out daily functions . negative for fever or unintentional weight loss . gu is significant for urinary incontinence and wearing a diaper . negative for genital sores , decreased or painful output . neurological significant for continued walking impairment and cognitive impairment . negative for headaches , recent falls , or hallucinations . psychiatric is negative for depression , excessive worrying , or mood swings .
[doctor] let's go ahead and use the short pe . vitals , let's see , blood pressure is 124/80 , heart rate 64 , respirations 18 , weight 174 pounds , and pain zero out of 10 .
[doctor] mr . watson is a pleasant and cooperative man who's able to converse easily through , um , though his daughter does add some details . the shunt sight was clean , dry , and intact with a confirmed setting of two . um he was tested um for recent and remote memory , attention span , and concentration in fund of knowledge . he scored a 26 out of 30 on the mmse when tested with spelling and 25 out of 30 when tested with calculations . of note , he was able to get two of the three memory words with cuing , and the third with multiple choice . this was a slight improvement over his initial score of 23 out of 30 with calculations and 24 out of 30 with spelling . and at the time he was unable um in the previous test , excuse me , he was unable to remember any memory words with cuing without and only one with multiple choice .
[doctor] gait testing using the tinetti assessment tool . he was tested without an assistive device and received a gait score of six to eight out of 12 and a balance score of 12 out of 16 for a total score of 18 to 20 out of 28 . this is slightly improved from his initial score of 15 to 17 out of 28 .
[doctor] cranial nerves , pupils are equal . eoms are intact . face symmetric . no disarchria . motor normal for bulk and strength . coordination slow from no- finger to nose . of note , the ct scan from the head of 10/15/2020 shows a frontal horn span at the level of foramen of monro of 4.6 centimeters with a third ventricular contour that is flat with a span of 10 millimeters . by my reading there is a tiny amount of blood in the right front region with a tiny subdermal collection . this was not noticed or noted by the radiologist who stated any extra axial fluid collections . there is also substantial small vessel ischemic change .
[doctor] diagnosis adult hydrocephalus , gait impairment , urinary incontinence and urgency , and cognitive impairment .","[doctor] hi , christopher . how are you ?

[patient] i'm doing okay .
[chief] good to see you . i've been following you since may 2020 . so , this is my first visit since you had your shunt surgery . how have you been doing since then ? i know that you had some problems with your gait impairment , cognitive impairment , and decreased bladder control . how has that been going since you've been here ? how is your walking ? how has your balance been ? how about your bladder control ? have you had any problems with urinary incontinence or urinary leakage ? how are your blood pressures , heart rate , respiratory rate , and respiratory rate ? how many pounds have you gained since you last saw me ? i see that you're up to about 174 pounds . how's your blood pressure and heart rate ? are you having any pain at the shunt site or in the abdomen ? i noticed that you've had no headaches or any other symptoms since i last saw you . have you experienced any nausea or vomiting or any fever or any weight loss ? i notice that you wear a diaper . how about headaches or pain at your spine or in your abdomen ? how's that going ? i've noticed no headaches at all since you have had the surgery .
 
[patient] no headaches , no pain at all , no nausea , no vomiting , no fever , no weight loss , and no pain in my abdomen . i feel like i can walk to the dining room just fine but could not before my surgery , but now i can do it just fine . i'm able to get to the table just fine , but i still have some walking impairment . i do n't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing , but it's better than it used to be . so i'm glad to see that it's gotten a little bit better . i think it's good that you feel like you can have a normal conversation with your dad again . i know it's been a long time since we've seen him . i just want to tell him that i'm really glad that he's doing well . i can tell that he feels like he's getting back to himself . i mean , i know he's still got a lot of problems with his gait , but he's able to walk around the house now , but his balance has improved , and his thinking has improved as well . so that's good to hear . and i know you're glad to hear that , too ."

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Amanda Taylor is an 72-year-old woman who presents for a follow-up for hypertension. History includes significant alcohol use disorder and mild hypercholesterolemia. At last visit on April 16, BP was 130/90. After presenting at 150/100 she was prescribed hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg by mouth once daily and lisinopril 20 mg by mouth once daily. CMP and CBC were essentially unremarkable.

Mrs. Taylor admits to consuming alcohol 4-5 times a week and is interested in Naltrexone injections. She acknowledges that her blood pressure would likely improve if she stopped alcohol consumption. She is checking her blood pressure in the morning and evening, stating it is higher at night but will improve after sitting for a few minutes. She is averaged 135-145 or 150 over 95-110.

She experienced side effects from lisinopril, such as headaches, “swooshing” in her left ear, and lethargy. She took half a dose and did not experience the side effects.

ASSESSMENT

• Alcohol use disorder.
• Hypertension.

Mrs. Taylor presents for a follow-up for hypertension. History includes significant alcohol use disorder and mild hypercholesterolemia. At last visit on April 16, BP was 130/90. After presenting at 150/100 she was prescribed hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg by mouth once daily and lisinopril 20 mg by mouth once daily. CMP and CBC were essentially unremarkable.

PLAN

Alcohol use disorder
I will start her on naltrexone which we have previously discussed. She will take the injectable form and start on May 17. We reviewed side effects and risks. The potential benefit of alcohol cessation would be highly beneficial to the patient.

Hypertension
She will continue taking lisinopril 10 mg/day and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg daily. Quite possibly her blood pressure will improve significantly if she is able to completely stop consuming alcohol. Target BP is 130-140/70-80. I will see her back week of June 14 which likely will be the time of her second naltrexone injection.

Recommend upgrading influenza vaccination and Shingrix #2, she defers this.

INSTRUCTIONS

Call the clinic with any questions. Make follow up appointment week of June 14th.

[doctor] hi miss taylor , how are you today ?
[patient] hi , i'm- i'm good , thank you .
[doctor] thanks for coming in today .
[patient] yeah , no problem .
[doctor] so how have things been going for you ?
[patient] uh , they've been all right . i'm struggling with not drinking . i wanted to discuss that , uh , shot that you had mentioned last time , but we did n't get to discuss it too much .
[doctor] okay , well i'll be happy to provide you with more information . so tell me when did you last have a drink ?
[patient] on monday .
[doctor] okay , so you've gone a couple days without it ?
[patient] yeah , yeah i have .
[doctor] yeah , and had you been drinking for a while ?
[patient] yep .
[doctor] how much had- how much had you been drinking ?
[patient] um , four or five times a week hard alcohol , so , you know .
[doctor] okay . well it will certainly help your blood pressure if you're able to stop drinking .
[patient] yeah , yeah i- i- i agree with you .
[doctor] okay . are you taking your blood pressure medications ?
[patient] yeah , but i'm only taking half of the lisinopril .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] i- b- well , the first time i took it i felt lethargic and tired , so i only took a half dose the next time . i felt much better and i did n't have the headaches or the swooshing that started in my left ear . so i feel like it's definitely helping but i do n't know ... i know it's not gon na be okay until i stop drinking .
[doctor] and are you also taking the full dose of the hydrochlorothiazide ? do you have any , um , chest tightness or pressure or any shortness of breath ?
[patient] yeah i'm taking the full dose of that medicine too , and no none of those symptoms .
[doctor] okay . anything else i should be aware of or that we should be checking ?
[patient] mm , no .
[doctor] okay , good . are you doing the blood pressure checks at home ?
[patient] yes . yes i am .
[doctor] okay good . what kind of numbers are you seeing ?
[patient] well , in the morning i'm seeing lower numbers than in the evening , um , where i run anywhere from like 130 to 145 or 150 over 95 to 100 on the bottom .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] but in the evenings if i sit there for a while and then take it , it goes down . kind of like when i come here it's always high but then it goes down . in the mornings it's generally more normal where it's supposed to be .
[doctor] uh- .
[patient] mm , also i'm taking my medicine in the morning when i get up instead of in the evening .
[doctor] yeah , so it sounds like we are not too far out of where we wan na be .
[patient] right , mm-hmm .
[doctor] okay . well let me get a listen to your heart , go ahead and hop up here .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] use my general exam template . all right , go ahead and take some deep breaths . okay , good . any fever , cough , shortness of breath or sore throat ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] any recent travel or contact or exposure to the coronavirus ?
[patient] nope .
[doctor] have you received your coronavirus vaccine ?
[patient] yes , on february 9th .
[doctor] okay , great . all right well i'm just going to look at your ankles and feet , i'm looking for any signs of swelling .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right , well everything looks good . you can go ahead and sit up miss taylor . all right , so the good news is everything is looking okay . i think we both agree if you were able to stop drinking your blood pressure would cease to be an issue for you .
[patient] yeah i agree with that .
[doctor] so let us discuss the potential medicine to help you with that . what it does is it blocks some of the brain receptors that alcohol stimulates and it tricks the brain into thinking it does not need alcohol , thereby cutting down the urges .
[patient] the urge to drink or the constant thinking about it ?
[doctor] it actually will help with both .
[patient] okay . so is it like a one-time thing ?
[doctor] generally the shot is given about once a month , it can also be given as a daily pill , but the shot does tend to work a bit better .
[patient] yeah i've taken things like this in the past and if it is a pill , i know i wo n't take it . with a shot , it's not like you can un-take it .
[doctor] yeah that's true . and the shot has been shown to work , it is more just a matter of getting you in to get your shot a month later with the nurse .
[patient] yeah , sure , sure .
[doctor] okay , so it's called naltrexone . i think the other name might be vivitrol . like i've said , the research on it is pretty good .
[patient] i think i may have taken the naltrexone before .
[doctor] okay , yeah , maybe you have .
[patient] yeah , if it was available in a pill form then i'm almost certain i've tried it b- before .
[doctor] okay . if this sounds good though , we can go ahead get you started with the shot . i am looking and it looks like we have you coming back in on may 17th for your first shot , does that sound good ?
[patient] yeah , yeah , that sounds great . are there any possible side effects ?
[doctor] yeah , some people will experience some nausea , headache , dizziness , anxi- anxiety , tiredness and trouble sleeping , but generally the side effects are mild and should go away within a few days .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] then we can schedule you for a follow-up in june to see how you are doing .
[patient] all right that sounds good .
[doctor] all right great . well otherwise stay with your current medicines , keep checking your blood pressure , and let's see if we can stop the alcohol for good . let us know if you have any questions or any issues come up after you receive the first dose .
[patient] all right , sounds good , thank you .

[patient] no , i took the whole dose . i did n't feel any of those things . i just felt a little bit tired and a little achy , but nothing really bad . i took half of it and it did help me feel a little better , but i still feel like my blood pressure is higher in the morning and evening . i'm not sure if that's because i'm drinking too much alcohol or if it's just because it's getting higher at night . i do n't know . i think it's probably just the alcohol , but it's hard to tell . i know it's high at night but it will improve after sitting for a few minutes . i'll take a few breaths and then it'll go back down .

Full-spectrum sexually transmitted disease testing.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Ms. Ross is a 23-year-old female who presents today as a new patient for full-spectrum STD testing.

The patient states that she is having symptoms of discomfort, a change in discharge, and an odor in her vaginal region. She says that the right side of her vagina is starting to become painful but denies any fever or chills. She states that she recently learned her partner of 3 years has been engaging in sexual encounters with other people for quite some time, and she wants to be evaluated for all sexually transmitted diseases.

Ms. Ross reports noticing a change in the odor, color, and consistency of her vaginal discharge last week. She notes that this did not alarm her until the right side of her vagina became painful and sore, which has not subsided. She states that she had an abnormal Pap Smear around the age of 20, but all her Pap Smears since then, including her most recent one approximately 6 months ago, have all been normal.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Genitourinary
Pelvic exam: No external lesions, normal labia majora and labia minora. Normal physiological discharge with normal color and odor. Cervix is normal, vaginal wall is normal, no cervical motion tenderness or masses noted. Swabs were obtained for sexual transmitted disease testing.

ASSESSMENT

Rheumatoid arthritis management.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Mr. Nelson is a 72-year-old male who presents today for ongoing management of rheumatoid arthritis. He was last seen by me on 03/04/2021, where he received a steroid injection to his right knee. He continues to experience right knee pain and swelling. The pain level is 6/10. He notes when he stands after he has been sitting for a while, he has to use a cane to ""get his bearings."" The injection he received to the right knee at the last visit was only beneficial for a few weeks. The patient notes whole right leg swelling since the last visit. He usually wears support hose, which helps to some degree. He has not attended physical therapy.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Musculoskeletal
Lower right extremity: Swollen right knee, slightly reduced range of motion. Skin warm to touch. Lower right leg pits with pressure.

PROCEDURE

Fluid aspiration and Steroid injection.
Risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained. The risks of steroid injection were explained, including but not limited to, hypopigmentation, soft tissue atrophy, tendon ruptures, and transient hyperglycemia among others. Verbal consent was obtained. The right knee was accessed through the lateral approach with 3 mL of initially clear fluid then blood-tinged fluid. Then the right knee was prepped in a standard fashion. The right knee was injected with 80 mg triamcinolone and 1 mL lidocaine. The procedure was tolerated well with no complications. Post procedure instructions were given.

ASSESSMENT

• Rheumatoid arthritis management.
• High risk medication use.
• Right knee pain.
• Lower extremity pitting edema.

PLAN

Rheumatoid arthritis management.
The patient will continue Xeljanz XR 11 mg daily. He will also continue Celebrex 200 mg daily.

High-risk medication use.
The patient is currently on the high-risk medication Xeljanz. We will check his CMP levels and monitor periodically every couple of months.

Right knee pain.
He has right knee pain and swelling, with pain level 6/10. On exam today, the right knee continues to be hot, which is ongoing inflammation. We performed a fluid aspiration of the right knee today, see procedure note above. A steroid injection to the right knee was given today, see procedure note above. We will arrange for x-ray of the right knee and refer his to physical therapy.

Lower extremity pitting edema.
The patient notes whole right leg swelling since the last visit. He usually wears support hose, which helps to some degree. He has not seen his PCP. We discussed compression stockings, elevate feet, and a low salt diet. He will check with his PCP for further instructions.","[doctor] tyler nelson , date of birth : 3 , 6 , 1949 , mrn , 385729 . he is here today for ongoing management of rheumatoid arthritis . last time he was here , he received a steroid injection in his right knee . hello mr. nelson , how are you ?
[patient] um , about the same as last time . my knee is still swollen .
[doctor] that was your right knee , correct ? i take it the injection did n't help ?
[patient] it did , maybe for a couple of weeks .
[doctor] that's it ? and is it still painful ?
[patient] yeah , it's pretty painful , and now the whole leg is getting swollen .
[doctor] okay , what would you say your pain level is ?
[patient] i mean , right now it's about a 3 or so , but , typically on a normal day it's around 6 .
[doctor] okay , and its been swollen like that for how long now ?
[patient] since i was last here a couple weeks after that . so about , maybe two months now .
[doctor] okay , but before it was just the knee ?
[patient] yeah , the whole thing was n't swollen like this , but i tried to wear compression socks a lot of the time , but it has n't been helping .
[doctor] okay , okay , so that has n't been working for you ?
[patient] i mean , it helps to some degree , but it's still swollen , especially around the knee .
[doctor] hmm . has it been keeping you from doing things during the day ?
[patient] well , i slowed down a little bit , and i found a few things too fast . but when it really hurts , is when i've been sitting for a while , and then i have to try and get up . i'm so stiff getting up i have to use a cane to get my bearings . i mean , after a little bit , it loosens up , but that first getting up is real difficult .
[doctor] yeah , i can see , that makes sense . have you been taking your medication regularly ? your on xeljanz right ?
[patient] yeah , the xr , i think its , uhm , 11 milligrams a day ? yeah , but i'm taking it everyday , and i'm also taking celebrex which i started maybe 2 months ago .
[doctor] yes , the 200mgs daily . how's that working for you ?
[patient] pretty good , up until it started swelling again .
[doctor] okay , well come sit over here , and if you could take of your socks and shoes , and we'll take a look at your knee . and just to let you know , i have a service now that writes my note about the visit , so you'll hear me call things out and describe what i see fully .
[patient] okay , gotcha .
[doctor] right , so let's check your leg . can you straighten it , and does it hurt ?
[patient] yeah , when i try to straighten it all the way it does .
[doctor] okay , range of motion slightly diminished . i'm going to press here , okay ? and how about here , hmm , i see some pitting around the knee and ankle . normal capillary refill in the toes . does any of this area hurt ?
[patient] um , just kinda sore , like an old bruise ?
[doctor] so , i can feel that the knee is hot , and that means there's something going on , like some inflammation . so we can give you another steroid injection for that . i also want to get an x-ray of that knee , so we can see where all the swelling is coming from .
[patient] yeah . let's do it . sounds go to me .
[doctor] okay , and did we set up physical therapy for you last time you were here ?
[patient] yeah , that was some years ago , but that was the other knee .
[doctor] okay . so i think we'll set that up for you now . we'll also do an x-ray on that knee . i can send you for a physical therapy , and if nothing is helping , then we really might need to get a surgery consult to see what we can do with that knee .
[patient] okay , sounds like a plan .
[doctor] all right , so for today we'll go ahead and we'll give you the steroid shot . i'll try to see if i can get a little bit of fluid out before i do give you the injection . there might be no fluid , but i'll see if i can get anything out regardless .
[patient] okay . and that's a procedure you're going to do right now ?
[doctor] yep . once we're done talking here , and as far as the edema in your legs , uh , we'll take an x-ray to look for the cause , but there is a lot you can do as well . the compression socks are a good start . um , and also , do you eat a lot of salt ?
[patient] i mean , um , i mean i love my salty snacks .
[doctor] okay . well , salt does have a tendency to make your body hold on to water , reducing your salt intake could help with some of the swelling . you can also prop your feet up any time you get a chance , especially at night . and have you talked to your private care doctor about this at all ?
[patient] no , i figured i would just come here first .
[doctor] okay . so i think , try some of those things out first , and if it does n't help , definitely make an appointment with them , also , as you know , xeljanz is a high-risk medication , so we need to check your cmp levels every couple of months . so this time your levels are good , but do make sure to make an appointment for the blood work for next time .
[patient] all right . i can do that . thank you so much doc .
[doctor] yes , of course . well let me go ahead and get supplies and we'll get to work on your knee .
[doctor] fluid aspiration and steroid injection procedure . the risks , benefits , and alternatives were explained . the risks of steroid injection were explained , including , but not limited to : hypopigmentation , soft tissue atrophy , tendon ruptures , and transient hypoglycemia among others . verbal consent was attained . the right knee was , uh , um , accessed through the lateral approach with 3 milliliters of initially clear fluid , then bloo- blood tinged fluid . then the right knee was prepped in a standard-fashion . the right knee was injected with 80 milligrams of triamcinolone , and one milliliter of lidocaine . the procedure was tolerated well , with no complications . post-procedure instructions were given . patient will follow up with his pcp . thank you .","[doctor] hi , mrs. nelson . how are you ?

[patient] i'm doing okay . i'm here for ongoing management of rheumatoid arthritis .
 
[doctor] okay . so , you know , you were last seen by me on march , fourteenth , twenty-four , 2021 . how have you been doing ? i know that you received a steroid injection to your right knee . how is your knee doing ? so , i know you were on the high-risk medication , the xeljanz , and you were also on the Celebrex . how has your knee been doing since then ? how is the swelling gone down ? how much pain has it been in your knee ? how long has the swelling been going on ? and have you had any pain relief from the steroid injection ? how about any swelling in your other leg ? how has that been going ? how's your right leg doing since the last time i saw you ? how are the swelling and pain in that leg going ? i mean , it's been a little bit swollen since last time , but it's still pretty much the same . i have to use a cane to get my bearings . i've been sitting for a while now , and it takes me a while to get back to my feet . i do n't know if that's normal or if it's just because of the medication , but i'm still having some pain and swelling in my knee . so i'm going to go ahead and do a physical exam .

"CHIEF COMPLAINT

Follow-up for perioral dermatitis.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Jacqueline Miller is a 40-year-old female who is being seen today for a follow-up skin exam for perioral dermatitis. She also has a history of rosacea, including ocular rosacea. Today, she states that her perioral dermatitis is well-controlled, although it has not fully resolved. The patient was applying doxycycline twice a day with improvement, but her pharmacist advised her to reduce to once daily since it had started to improve; therefore, for approximately the past week, she has been using the doxycycline only once per day. She has not seen continued improvement but it has not worsened. She is using the sulfacetamide wash twice daily, denies drying of the skin, and reports that her skin is much improved moisturization. She also applies MetroCream immediately after using the sulfacetamide wash. She denies using other lotions and products, Cetaphil lotion or soap, or Neutrogena wipes. The patient did not begin Elidel because it is not covered by her insurance, and she was concerned about possible side effects from the medication.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Perioral dermatitis.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Doxycycline cream. Apply twice daily.
MetroCream. 
Sulfacetamide wash. Apply topically twice daily.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Integumentary
Skin inspection of the face was performed today. On bilateral medial cheeks, there are a few, very faint, erythematous papules with mild redness around and underneath the nostrils. Fitzpatrick skin type is 4 to 5.

ASSESSMENT

• Perioral dermatitis
• Rosacea, including ocular rosacea

Jacqueline Miller is a 40-year-old female who presented today for follow-up for her perioral dermatitis, which has improved but not resolved. She decreased her doxycycline per her pharmacist’s recommendation, which possibly stagnated the resolution of symptoms.

PLAN

Perioral dermatitis.
I counseled the patient about the risks and benefits of doxycycline and recommended she resume twice daily application until she reaches full resolution, and at that point she should reduce application to once a day for an additional week. The patient will not be using Elidel as I reviewed the cost of the medication and without insurance, it was too expensive. I provided a prescription for Tacrolimus and counseled her on possible side effects of using the medication. She will continue with Sulfacetamide face wash once a day. Also, use Bruder mask as needed.

Rosacea, including ocular rosacea.
Continue using MetroCream twice daily. I recommended to gently wash her eyelids once daily with a gentle cleanser and try a gentle cream such as Vanicream.

INSTRUCTIONS

Call the clinic if symptoms worsen. The patient will have a follow-up appointment in 4 weeks.","[doctor] uh , mrn49282721 . patient's name is jacqueline miller . use last visit exam where appropriate .
[doctor] hi , how are you doing , jacqueline ?
[patient] i'm pretty . good . how are you ?
[doctor] good as well . so it sounds like we're , um , under good control right now .
[patient] yes . it's doing much better .
[doctor] good , good . do you have any rash leftover ?
[patient] yeah , i have a- a small bit leftover . i started using , uh , doxycycline only one a day because i think the pharmacist said if it's getting better , to just limit it to once a day .
[doctor] okay , that sounds good .
[patient] but i was taking it twice a day and i did notice a lotta improvement .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] and then when i started doing it only once a day , it seems the same and it's not continuing to get better . so it's kinda plateaued a little bit .
[doctor] i see . um , are you breastfeeding at this time ?
[patient] no , i'm not right now .
[doctor] okay , good . so you- you should not be breastfeeding while you're on that medication .
[patient] yeah , actually i stopped breastfeeding and then asked for the doxycycline at that time .
[doctor] okay . even with the doxycycline , you can keep using the elidel .
[patient] okay . and i did n't take the elidel because when i read about it i got worried . so i wanted to just try the doxycycline and see .
[doctor] okay . so we can talk about the elidel . a lot of the things you read about is not actually relevant to the cream or ointment form , but it's about the oral form that's used in really high doses , longterm , after people have a heart transplant or a kidney transplant or something like that .
[patient] okay . i did n't realize that .
[doctor] yeah , and when you suppress the immune system that hard for that long , it can predispose you for developing cancers like hematologic type cancers . it does n't apply to as-needed use of the medicine , a cream or an ointment , okay ?
[patient] okay . then i can resume taking - taking the doxycycline twice a day again ?
[doctor] so let me clarify . what exactly are you using ? and then we'll look at you and figure out , okay ? so you're using the sulfacetamide wash ? uh , how frequently are you using that one ?
[patient] twice a day .
[doctor] okay , and that's not drying you out too much ?
[patient] no , that's fine .
[doctor] okay . and you're using the metro cream ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] how often are you using that one ?
[patient] after my face wash , i immediately apply the cream .
[doctor] okay . and then , are you using any other kind of lotions or anything ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] so you're not using the cetaphil cleanser ?
[patient] i'm not .
[doctor] okay . and no neutrogena wipes ?
[patient] no wipes .
[doctor] okay . um , and then what about , um , any lotions that you're using ?
[patient] i'm not using any lotion right now , just those two .
[doctor] no lotion , okay . so that may be something else we should add in , a lotion to just help moisturize . but we'll see .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] um , and then again , when did you go down to just taking the doxycycline once a day ?
[patient] that was last week . so the first two weeks , i did twice a day .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] and then i started seeing improvement , and then i changed to just once a day .
[doctor] okay . let me take a look at your face here . i'm gon na describe for the transcriptionist what i'm seeing . you're fitzpatrick skin type iv , meaning you're not going to burn , you're going to sun tan , um , essentially , iv to v. and then on bilateral medial cheeks , there are a few really faint erythematous papules and just maybe a little bit of redness around and underneath your nostrils . so you're right , it's not totally gone .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] i think i would go ahead and go back to twice a day , every day , with the doxycycline .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] uh , but i would pickup the elidel too .
[patient] okay , i can do that .
[doctor] i mean , out of known risks associated with medications , topicals are usually safer and preferable to oral medications . with that being said , doxycycline is low risk .
[patient] it is ? okay .
[doctor] um , and doxycycline can give you bad upset stomach or heartburn . um , it will make you sunburn , even if you never sunburn , so you have to protect yourself .
[patient] yeah , i mean , i feel sun sensitive whenever i go out , so i am taking all the precautions , with wearing a hat and all of that .
[doctor] great . i just wanted to make sure you knew about that .
[patient] yes , i did . thank you .
[doctor] all right . but i think to help get rid of it sooner rather than later , if insurance will cover the elidel , pick it up and start using it .
[patient] yeah , i did check . the insurance is not covering it .
[doctor] it's not ? okay . well , let's look around really quick because if you use a goodrx coupon , it will be around 30 to $ 40 or something .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] let's see .
[patient] so with your coupon , it was around $ 850 or something .
[doctor] ugh , yeah . that's way too much .
[patient] i agree . and- and because i also looked at the eucrisa that you recommended in my notes , and if it's still ex- if it's still expensive , i could try that instead .
[doctor] yeah , so it ... actually ... it is actually more expensive . i think the prices fluctuate .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] because now it's showing the cheapest of $ 70 , and when i looked before , it was around 30 to $ 40 .
[patient] yeah . if it was around $ 200 , i would've picked it up . but it was coming to around $ 850 after insurance .
[doctor] okay . so i've found the cream form . we could try ointment form .
[patient] you mean the tacrolimus ?
[doctor] yeah , mm-hmm .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so if we send it to pick'n save or metro market ... let's see where else .
[patient] can you do the metro market ?
[doctor] yeah . let me put in the prescription and we'll see what we can find .
[patient] sure .
[doctor] pharmacy is what i'm trying to say .
[patient] okay . but it's not a steroid , right ?
[doctor] correct , it's not a steroid .
[patient] okay , good .
[doctor] it's called a calcineurin inhibitor . it's kinda like a steroid in that it calms inflammation .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] but it's not a steroid , so do n't use steroids on your face , for sure , as they'll make this kind of rash worse . but also , steroids carry the risk of causing thinning of the skin .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] these medications do n't cause thinning of the skin and they're not going to cause some other kind of rash . um , the thing to know is that sometimes five to 10 minutes after you put it on , it can cause this weird kind of tingly or needle-like sensation or make it redder or flush . but it should only last a few seconds and then go away . it's not an allergy or anything bad .
[patient] okay . got it .
[doctor] so it only lasts a couple seconds . it does n't mean it's going to happen again . it's nothing bad . it will still work , so keep using it as long as you know you can stand it , okay ?
[patient] okay , thank you for explaining .
[doctor] so i will say , "" apply to rash on face twice daily , until resolved . ""
[patient] okay . so only apply to the rash area ?
[doctor] yes , and keep using the face wash.
[patient] okay .
[doctor] i think you could just do it once a day . i do n't think you need to do it twice a day , just because i do n't wan na dry your sky out too much , okay ?
[patient] i never noticed that my face is dry or got thin . i feel so good after using it .
[doctor] i understand , but it could get dry and i do n't wan na create other problems for you .
[patient] all right . i'll just wash once a day with it . but it was feeling very good , like there's this little bit of moisture getting back in . with the other wash , when i would use it twice a day , i was drying out . but not with this one .
[doctor] i see . okay . well then do what feels good . if you do notice that you're starting to get dry , then reduce to once per day .
[patient] that sounds good .
[doctor] so to review , um , continue using the same face wash , continue with metro cream , and increase the use of doxycycline to twice a day .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and then just do it until it's gone , and then do it for once a day for another week before stopping .
[patient] okay , sounds good .
[doctor] all right . and i'll rewrite your instructions here .
[patient] thank you so much .
[doctor] if there are any other questions or you're getting different instructions , feel free to reach out to me and we'll clarify , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] but in general , doxycycline is such a low risk . we're not gon na have you on this forever . but especially since we're adding the tacrolimus , i expect it will clear quickly .
[patient] sounds good .
[doctor] all right . and i just wan na really help knock it out as fast as possible , since you've been dealing with it for so long now . i would take it twice a day until it's gone , and then once a day for a week before you stop . i'll write it out like that . so twice a day until rash is gone , and then once a day for another week before stopping .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] once the rash stops , you can stop the tacrolimus ointment . um , continue doxycycline another week and then stop . but you can keep using the wash and the metro cream .
[patient] okay , that sounds good . i can do that .
[doctor] and then hold off until i see you again before you start back any of your old products . um , if it's starting to flair again , um , if it's just a little bit , you can try just doing the tacrolimus for a couple days , to see if that's enough . if it's not , then restart the dy- doxycycline as well .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] i do n't expect that to happen , but , you know , if it does , you have the tools . um , then you'll be seeing me for a followup . we can figure out what to do next . i would say if it's getting worse rather than better , just give me a call or send me a mychart message , okay ?
[patient] yeah , sounds good .
[doctor] do you have enough refills ?
[patient] yeah , i think so .
[doctor] okay . so it looks like you have another refill of the doxycycline , so you're good there . metro cream , you probably still have enough of that one .
[patient] yes , i do .
[doctor] all right . and i'll cancel the elidel cream , just so we do n't complicate your list . uh , you have plenty of the face wash still .
[patient] yes .
[doctor] okay . uh , and we'll get rid of the clindamycin from your list as well .
[patient] and what would you suggest for a moisturizer ?
[doctor] yeah , so for that i would do something really basic like vanicream . or even , if it's just really dry , you could use a little bit of petroleum jelly . um , i'll give you a couple samples , okay ? let's make sure we have a followup in about four weeks .
[patient] okay , thank you .
[doctor] okay . and i would stay away from any kind of anti-aging thing , any kind of plant thing . um , really let's just be sure we talk about any new products , or reach out to me if you're gon na try something else . um , let's go get those samples .
[patient] okay , that sounds good .
[doctor] for assessment and plan , perioral dermatitis , rosacea , including ocular rosacea , and copy and paste her patient instructions . i recommend that she gently wash her eyelids once a day with gentle cleanser such as vanicream , also use bruder mask as needed .","[doctor] hi jacqueline . how are you ?

[patient] i'm doing okay .
(doctor] good . so , jacquel is a 40-year-old female here for follow-up for her perioral dermatitis , which has improved but it has not fully resolved . she's been taking doxycycline twice a day for about the past week , and it's started to improve . she also has a history of rosacea , so we're going to do a skin exam to check out those as well .
 
[doctor] okay . and , how is your skin looking ? i know that you've been using the sulfacetamide wash , but do you notice any drying of the skin or any redness around your nostrils ? and , uh , any spots on your cheeks or on the inside of your cheeks ? i mean , you know , it looks like it's well-controlled , but it's still there . i'm not sure if it's going to go away or if it'll just stay there . so i want you to tell me a little bit more about what's going on with your skin .
[ patient] yeah . it looks much better . i do n't think it's drying out at all . i think it just looks a little red around my nostrils and around my cheeks , and there are a few, very faint, erythematous papules around and underneath the nostrils , but otherwise , it's looking pretty good . i just have to keep it under control . i know my dermatologist told me to take it once a day , but my pharmacist advised me to reduce it to once daily since it had started to better . so for the past about a week now , i've been taking it once per day . i have n't seen any continued improvement , but i'm still taking it . i've just been waiting for it to get better so that i can go back to my regular doctor . and i'm really glad that you're taking it , because it's been a long time since you've had any dermatitis before . i was really worried about you taking the medication because it is not covered by your insurance , and you were concerned about possible side effects from the medication . so let's go ahead and do a quick skin exam . let's talk about your skin type . i see that you have a redness on your right cheek , your right nostril , and on your left cheek . so your skin"
"CHIEF COMPLAINT

Abdominal pain.

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports history of type 2 diabetes.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient reports enjoying nature photography.

FAMILY HISTORY

Patient reports family history of cholelithiasis. Both of his parents have had cholecystectomies.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Constitutional: Reports low-grade fevers.
Gastrointestinal: Reports right-sided abdominal pain and nausea. Denies vomiting.

VITALS

Blood Pressure: 128/88 mmHg.
Respiratory Rate: 16 breaths per minute.
Heart Rate: 68 beats per minute.
Oxygen Saturation: 99% on room air.
Body Temperature: Afebrile.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Respiratory
- Auscultation of Lungs: Clear and equal bilaterally.

Cardiovascular
- Auscultation of Heart: Regular rate and rhythm. No ectopic beats. No murmurs, clicks, or rubs.

Gastrointestinal
- Examination of Abdomen: Soft, nondistended abdomen. Positive slight guarding to the right upper quadrant, but without rebound tenderness. Positive for Murphy signs. Peritoneal signs not appreciated.
- Auscultation: Bowel sounds normal in all 4 quadrants.

RESULTS

Abdominal ultrasound obtained at an outside facility is reviewed today. This demonstrates multiple gallstones present in the gallbladder. I do appreciate some mild thickening. The common bile duct size is within normal limits at 4.1 mm.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Mild cholecystitis with gallstones.
- Medical Reasoning: Based on the patient's symptoms, exam findings, and ultrasound, I do believe he has some mild cholecystitis with gallstones. I do not appreciate any frank obstruction, but it looks like his gallbladder is inflamed. This appears to have happened maybe over the last few weeks or since he has been symptomatic.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I had a thorough discussion with the patient concerning surgical treatment. The preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative courses of care were described and discussed. I explained the surgery will take approximately 1 to 1.5 hours, and he will probably spend the night in the hospital for post-procedure monitoring. We also discussed that he should avoid high fat foods after surgery and eat foods that are high in fiber. All questions were answered.
- Medical Treatment: Since he has not had any improvement with dietary modifications, I recommend a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. A mutually agreed upon surgical date has been scheduled for 1 week.

2. Type 2 diabetes.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient is currently managing his diabetes with diet and exercise.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I advised the patient he should refrain from hiking in the immediate postoperative period; however, he may return to walking outdoors on solid ground 1 week status post-surgery.
Medical Treatment: I recommended he follow up with his physician regarding his impending surgery. We will continue to monitor his diabetes as has been outlined by either his endocrinologist or his primary care provider.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me 1 week status post-surgery.","[doctor] hey good morning bobby how are you
[patient] i'm doing okay i as you're aware doctor miller sent me over for this pain in my belly that i've had for several weeks they did he did an ultrasound and and said i had gallstones and they recommended i stay several way from some high fat food but i'm just still having a lot of pain and he referred me to you
[doctor] alright well i'm i'm sorry to hear that you're having pain but i i'm glad that he sent you over to see me i wan na talk a little bit more about that pain can you describe the kind of pain that you feel
[patient] well it's it's on the right hand side of my belly it's it's right underneath my ribs and it feels like a a squeezing severe pain it comes and goes but when it comes it's really severe and i get kind of nauseated and sick in my stomach
[doctor] okay and then when you get that pain can you rate that pain for me on a scale like zero being none ten being the worst pain you've ever been in your life
[patient] when it's severe it's it's probably an eight
[doctor] okay alright and then time wise are we looking at can it just come and go anytime or is it specifically around mealtimes how how does that pain kinda wax and wane for you
[patient] most of the time it comes right after i eat
[doctor] okay
[patient] but it also can come on a couple of hours after i eat also so it's either immediately after i eat or a couple hours later but it's related to eating
[doctor] okay
[patient] you know i like to eat right
[doctor] do n't weigh all so speaking of eating let's talk a little bit about your diet i see here on your chart that you're a type two diabetic and it looked like that you were gon na handle that with diet and exercise let's talk about that a little bit
[patient] well you know i my my diet was worse when i before i was diagnosed with the the type two diabetes
[doctor] okay
[patient] and since then i've cut back on sugar and i started a little bit of a keto diet and i've lost about twenty five pounds over the last three months
[doctor] okay so other than the weight loss how how is your diet is that has that been working out for you i mean do you does does that does that fit your lifestyle pretty well
[patient] yeah it does it does it it i was surprised it was n't as hard as i thought to go back and cut back and go more of a keto diet
[doctor] okay
[patient] but you know trying to cut out all those carbs my symptoms got better
[doctor] yeah
[patient] with the diabetes and my my blood sugars are improving but i still get that pain underneath the ribs
[doctor] yeah and that can happen and one of those things that causes that is that those intake of that fatty foods which is you know kind of the the keystone or the hallmark of the keto diet and have you noticed any improvement when you do cut out that fatty food and has that been difficult since you are watching your carb intake
[patient] the fatty food it is a little bit difficult you know i like those pork grinds and you know i i've had to kind of cut those out they were a nice staple for me when i was on the keto diet but i have cut out the those pork rinses because those were just so delicious and you know i would say it's a little bit better but i still get that pain
[doctor] okay and then do you have any family history of gallbladder disease
[patient] yeah but you know you know i knew that was coming both my dad and my mother both had gallbladder disease and had to have their gallbladders off
[doctor] okay so both both your parents your mom and your dad had your had their gallbladders taken out

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his x-rays revealed an acute acromioclavicular joint fracture. The plan is to place the patient in a sling and prescribe meloxicam 15 mg once a day to treat his pain. I also recommend that we obtain a CT scan of the right shoulder to evaluate further. I recommend that the patient attend formal physical therapy to strengthen his right shoulder in hopes of avoiding surgery in the future. In the meantime, I have advised him to avoid tackle football.","[doctor] hi matthew how are you the medical assistant told me that you injured your shoulder
